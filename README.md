# hello-world
My first project in github. My first repository. I'm ready to learn.
My name is Olesea. I finished IT 14 years ago, but I have never worked in this field. I currently work in banking ... Cristina organized the given courses and I thought it would be a great opportunity to recap, but I realize that I am learning everything again...))
I want to learn to code.
